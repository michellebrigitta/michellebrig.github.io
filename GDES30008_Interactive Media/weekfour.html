                    <h2> WOT is Generative Design? </h2>
                    <p> Generative art is a form of artistic endeavour in which the artist develops a process—be it a computer 
                        programme, a machine, a set of rules for natural language, or another procedural invention—and then sets it into action 
                        with a certain amount of autonomy to either contribute to or produce a finished work of art. </p>

                    <p> For the fourth Hunt'n'Gather, we gathered 3 interesting gaming environments. As someone who loves playing games, I had a really fun time
                        researching for this particular theme! The games I chose are: Mobile Legends, which is a 5v5 moba game on mobile phone, It Takes Two, which is a 2 player
                        interactive game, and Valorant, a First-Person Shooter game on PC. All these games are the ones I am most interested in as I became curious on how the gaming
                        engine is built. All of them have its own gaming world built on intricate virtual 3D models. On the Look! section, I looked at Angelo Plessas and New Rafael.com.
                        Personally, I really liked Angelo's site as it contains quirky and funny animations with sounds which gives an eery vibe :o. Rafael's site on the other hand, 
                        is very refreshing and aesthetically to my eyes. It contains a lot of cool graphics as he also serves it as NFTs. </p>

                    <h2> Workshop: Offline Algorithmic Thinking </h2>
                    <p> In this week's workshop, we learned about generative art: creating art with a set of rules, which leads to how we must make some kind
                        of algorithm. To further explore this idea, we were told to create formulas with the throw of a dice. We must draw an object on the canvas, using pen
                        and grid paper, but the qualities of the object: like its colors, size, and shape must be determined within the throw of a dice. In a pair of two with
                        Ileana, we set on a formula to determine all qualities of the object, using just two dices (6-faced dice as Y & 8-sided dice as X). Within one throw, we could determine the object's colour (in RGB 
                        values), size, and the shape (using numbers on 6-faced dice: 1 = circle, 2 = ellipse, 3 = square, 4 = rectangle, 5 = triangle, 6 = circle). 
                        <br> </br>
                        Our formula works! But the distance within shapes is too small, so the spread of the shapes was unbalanced. This activity really got my brain going as I have to 
                        establish a mathematical formula. However, it is really stimulating to think what it would be like, if our life depended on the throw of a dice.... </p>

                    <h2> Workshop: Let's go!! </h2>
                    <p> The exciting part, we finally get to taste what p5js feels like!! This is my first time using p5js, and I can say it was magical. In this 
                        workshop, we followed a live coding demo on how to start a P5 basic sketch, make a responsive, full screen sketch and of course, adding shapes, colours, 
                        and text. We did a mapping of random circles with randomized colors as well as a free-hand drawing function and draw the people beside us. <b> As I learned 
                            JavaScript before, setting up a canvas and building a drawing function in JS takes so much time and effort. P5js does it effortlessly which for me, is 
                            very exhilirating!! </b> </p>
