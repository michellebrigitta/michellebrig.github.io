                    <h2> Research for Personal Project </h2>
                    <p> With all the knowledge I've earned and circuits I've built over the past three weeks, I compiled a research of what to 
                        do for my final project. I thought about a number of ideas such as: a pill dispenser machine, a candy dispenser machine that gives you 
                        candy that matches your shirt color, walking robot that detects lines and moves along the lines, little robot arm that moves left and 
                        right, up to an LED machine robot that have feelings and will react to gestures we give them. I decided early on a short while after
                        learning Arduino that I wanted to do physical computing with Arduino for my last project, as I want to step away from the screen and
                        build an immersive experience for people to interact with. My last two options comes down to the color-sorting candy dispenser machine 
                        and the LED machine sensitive robot, which I ultimately went for the candy dispenser machine as I want my project to be fun and enjoyable. </p>

                    <h2> Physical Computing: Non-human Drawing Machines </h2>
                    <p> <b> It's all about process, power, and control. </b>
                        <br> 
                        In this era of digitalization, Machines and Artificial Intelligence is taking over humans, from how they do their daily activities
                        to their jobs. This week's seminar delve deeper into Non-human Drawing Machines, which are able to create a whole new "art." However, 
                        when a computer is credited with composing an artwork, is the device truly exhibiting "creativity"? Furthermore, can the resulting product 
                        genuinely be considered art? Ambiguity surrounds the classification of these artistic works and the creative processes involved. An example
                        we have explored before is in Harold Cohen's AI artmaking program called AARON. A distinctive feature about his machine is that it does not 
                        instantly generate images within users input like the usual AI programs we know, but as a live machine, it shows the process of making the 
                        image from the very first brush stroke. <b> His device hopes to make people see AI as a tool, not as a solution. </b> That "art" puts its emphasis on 
                        the process and became a cumulative body of work that is asking a question.

                    <h2> Hunt'n'Gather #9! </h2>
                    <p> For the last Hunt'n'Gather, we continue to explore the realm of physical computing. I researched a lot about Laura Splan, New York City based 
                        visual artist working at the intersections of Science, Technology, and Culture. Her works incorporate a lot of intricate datas such as from an Electroencephalogram 
                        (EEG) or an Electromyography (EMG), shown through one of her works "Recursive Expressions" where the EMG data was visualized in the form of a repeated, rotated, and 
                        randomly colorized EMG wave forms. Other than that, she also plays with Processing as she built her "autologousReflection" using the software, mainly playing on the 
                        webcam function and reflection. Her works really inspired me as someone who is still figuring out what to do with creative coding, and pushes me to think further.
                        Additionally, I also found a buildable Arduino project by Joselyn McDonald called Forget Me Not, which is a remote plant-watering device. Seeing her projects pushed
                        me to brainstorm for my final project idea, in which I also wanted to use Arduino to build a physical device. </p>

                    <h2>  Workshop: TOUCH! </h2>
                    <p> In this week's workshop, we set up a circuit with LED lights that will respond within touch by lighting up.
                        The materials used for this were: breadboard, motherboard, LED lights, two types of ohm resistors, and wires. Me and Ileana,
                        my partner for the day successfully build the circuit as the LED lights up when we touch the unconnected end of the wire. 
                        We then proceed to experiment using aluminium foils and electrical clips that were able to extend the part where we touch to 
                        be larger, as they are very good conductors of electricity. This is a really compelling circuit as I can think about the electrical
                        clips being attached to someone or something (like a piece of clothing or some wearables), and touching them can be a sort of button
                        to light up the LED or to activate something. </p>

                    <h2> Workshop: Hand Sensor Game #1 </h2>
                    <p> Rather than building something, for this activity Karen Ann brought a hand sensor with a virtual reality game That
                        can sense the motions of our hands. We get to try and play the game, which for the first one, is about the growth of a flower. The 
                        game can go in two different directions: <p> </p>
                        1. We can pluck each petals of the flower or <p> </p>
                        2. Rip the whole flower apart<br> </br>
                        If we chose to pluck each petals, the detached petals will morph into a goldfish swimming around the pond. Otherwise, when we rip 
                        the whole flower apart, no goldfish will appear. Both paths lead to the flower being regrown and the cycle continues. The whole class
                        had fun playing with it and it's personally a really memorable experience for me as it is the first time I have ever tried a hand sensor. 
                        The device is small and attached with a USB cable, which I am impressed with by how portable and small the device is. It is really intriguing 
                        to think about what kind of codes were deployed to make such an intricate device work. </p>

                    <p> Still utilizing the same hand sensor device, other than the flower game there is also this cube stacking game. The objective
                        is to pick up the cubes on the floor and give it to the robots entering the arena, which will become their heads. This game is slightly harder
                        than the other one, but it's interesting to think about the sensor's sentivitiy to movements and the preciseness it tracks. </p>
