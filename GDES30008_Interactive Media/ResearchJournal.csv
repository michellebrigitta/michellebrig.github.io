leftDoubleImage,Nomadic Tribe,"Website by Make Me Pulse, 2020","Nomadic Tribe is an award winning website recognized for its intricate animations and storytelling. The site itself was made by a team of creatives called Make Me Pulse. The concept of Nomadic Tribe is centered on a 
mysterious community inhabiting various islands, migrating annually while fulfilling their responsibilities. Within this fantastical graphic setting, these individuals coexisted harmoniously with nature, possessing the ability to communicate 
with it. Their primary focus on each island was nurturing the ecosystem back to its former vitality. As each year concluded, they bid farewell to their current home, embarking on a journey to new territories. Almost all parts of the graphics
are interactive, users can click and drag the mouse the grow a flower, hold to make the birds fly faster, and move their mouse as the foreground graphic follows through, creating a realistic viewpoint render. With an original story and soundtrack, the Make Me Pulse team worked meticulously on every little detail to create an immersive experience that people would remember. 
      
It worked greatly as this website left a really strong impression on me as I encounter it in the 
start of the semester, and ultimately became the primary inspiration in how I developed my website with the concept of a growing flower. I thought it was the perfect chance as the concept of a nurturing nature and growing a flower matches how I will update my website throughout the weeks of Interactive Media. Just like how a flower blooms from a humble seed into a captivating beauty, my website will reflect my own growth in knowledge and understanding as I navigate the challenges and rewards of this subject. It's a testament to the transformative power of learning, where every obstacle and triumph contributes to the vibrant tapestry of personal development. However, I am still discovering the broad subject of creative coding, hence why my website will not be as advanced.",https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1367633/screenshots/6889684/flowers.gif,https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/1367633/screenshots/7012251/desert.gif,"Nomadic Tribe, Make Me Pulse, 2019, https://2019.makemepulse.com.","Nomadic Tribe, Make Me Pulse, 2019, https://2019.makemepulse.com.",https://2019.makemepulse.com,"CreativeCoding, Illustration, Interactive, Playable",

His abstract art does not depict things that are recognisable such as people, objects or landscapes. Instead he used colours, geometrical shapes, and textures to achieve the desired effect. His emphasize in boundaries and preciseness of form inspired me to utilize geometrical shapes in generating a p5js sketch. This is particularly visible in the ""BTW: Behind The Web!"" page of my website, where I used the rectFill code line to produce rectangles of different heights, weights, and colors randomized at different positions. Ultimately, Mondrian sparked my interest in playing with geometrical shapes and its values of colors.

Kwok's works have garnered global recognition, being showcased at various prestigious media art and film festivals such as Ars Electronica, Electronic Language International Festival (FILE), Vienna Independent Shorts (VIS), Punto y Raya (PyR), Resonate, FIBER, and others. He mainly uses the software Processing to create his interactive artworks. Having learned Processing in workshops, Kwok's works are very enticing and inspiring. It feels simple but at the same time, complicated. I particularly really enjoyed his ""Self-Similarity (2022),"" where blocks of cubes divides and multiplies itself to form littler cubes, ultimately forming an eye-catching abstract composition. Despite his serious and composed works that grants him the opportunity to collaborate with well-known brands, he also have archives of his past works where it is we can visibly see that he enjoys playing around with Processing so much, shown through one of his unique work ""Doge Goo (2015).""

Renowned for his adeptness in seamlessly integrating visual and sonic elements, Ikeda intricately weaves together sound, visuals, materials, physical phenomena, and mathematical concepts to craft immersive live performances and installations. Beyond his musical endeavors, Ikeda has embarked on various long-running projects spanning live performances, installations, publications, and albums, including 'datamatics' (2006-), 'test pattern' (2008-), 'spectra' (2001-), ‘cyclo.’ (a collaborative effort with Carsten Nicolai), ‘superposition’ (2012-), 'supersymmetry' (2014-), and ‘micro | macro’ (2015-). His most popular work, ""test pattern (2008),"" is a system that converts any type of data whether it be text, sounds, photos or movies, into barcode patterns and binary patterns of 0s and 1s. It can be said that Ikeda visualises data inputs and turned it into a designed output in the form of barcode patterns. This is an ongoing work of his that have many different design outputs, such as: an audiovisual installation, pigment print, film rolls, book, CD, and site-specific installations. Through its application, the project aims to examine the relationship between critical points of device performance and the threshold of human perception. Ikeda's work has a sentimental touch that explores the interaction and connection between human and technology. I, too, want to create an artwork that can give a meaning to those who see it, to tell a story that lies beneath a design.

With a keen interest in creative coding and physical computing, she crafts compelling innovative visual experiments and interactive designs. One of her most interesting works is the visual identity she did for We Are Playground, an art festival in Berlin. The use of vibrant colors are captivatingly eye-catching. As someone who studies Graphic Design, I found her work very skillfully executed and successful, which is such a huge inspiration for me. She uses creative coding to bridge the gap between the physical and digital world, by allowing viewers who came to the festival to interact with the artwork by touch of hand. Another prominent work of Zhu is her ""Google Pocket Garden (2022),"" which possess a similar theme as my website that is based on floral nature. This particular work adapts the concept of a community garden in your pocket which allows users to plant persistent virtual flowers and cacti, water them, and watch them grow and spread: kind of like Pokemon Go but for plants. Seeing Zhu's project, it helps me visualize the literal part of my website of having a watered flower that ""grows."" Though her work in this project is three dimensional, it also inspired me with certain aspects when forming the graphic assets of my website's scenery and flower, such as using gradients to create depth in the objects.

Her primary method of data translation is basket weaving, serving as a straightforward, tactile grid for interpreting data into three-dimensional space. At the core of this endeavor is Nathalie Miebach's fascination with the role that visual and musical aesthetics play in the translation and comprehension of intricate scientific systems, such as weather. A distinct characteristic in Miebach's works is how each of them bursts with colors which is very engaging and thought-provoking. The playfulness and physicality of her works inspired me in developing the idea for my final project, as I also wanted to do something fun and immerse myself more in the realm of physical computing. Looking at Miebach's works convinced me to move away from screens, hence working with Arduino to create a working circuit.

Rozendaal's artistic creations manifest in various forms, ranging from immersive installations to browser windows, artist books, and public spaces. Rozendaal's works is one of the earliest artist I came upon as I knew him from the subject's hunt'n'gather. Personally, I think his works show a clear, direct, and stunning baseline of creating a p5js sketch. It is colorful, it draws attention with the sound effects attached to the movement of the objects.
