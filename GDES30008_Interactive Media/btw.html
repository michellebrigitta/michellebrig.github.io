      <div class="des"> <b> Why mountains and meadows? </b>
        <br> </br>
        As I crafted my website, I drew inspiration from the majestic mountains and verdant meadows that adorned the landscapes of my childhood 
        home on the outskirts of Java. The breathtaking views of these natural wonders have been ingrained in my memories since I was a child, 
        holding a deeply sentimental significance for me. They represent more than just scenery; they embody a cherished part of my upbringing, 
        a constant source of comfort and inspiration. It's this connection to my past that drives me to weave elements of mountains and meadows 
        into my digital presence, ensuring that wherever I go, a piece of home travels with me. Just as I grew up surrounded by the towering peaks 
        and lush greenery, I want my website to embody the essence of growth and renewal, symbolized by a blossoming flower nested between the 
        mountains and meadows. It's a tribute to my upbringing and a testament to the transformative power of embracing one's history as a guiding 
        force toward a brighter future.
          <br> </br>

          <b> Why raining clouds and flower? </b>
          <br> </br>
          In crafting the concept for my website, I drew inspiration from the timeless symbolism of growth and renewal embodied by a blooming flower, 
          nurtured by the gentle embrace of its environment. Water, essential for a flower's growth, is represented through raining clouds, symbolizing 
          patience and perseverance. This concept serves as a poignant reminder that "good things take time," as my website will depict the journey of 
          a humble seed transforming into a resplendent flower. Just as the flower blossoms from its unassuming beginnings to a captivating beauty, my 
          website will reflect my own growth in knowledge and understanding as I navigate the challenges and rewards of my subject. It's a testament to 
          the transformative power of learning, where every obstacle and triumph contributes to the vibrant tapestry of personal development.
