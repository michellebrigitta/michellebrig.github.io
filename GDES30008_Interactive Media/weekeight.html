                    <h2> Self Arduino Experiments </h2>
                    <p> Upon having some knowledge of Arduino supplied from the circuit I built in class, I tried to experiment with it by modifying
                        and testing out each component used. This image here that is shown is a variation of the BLINK circuit I built on week seven, where I modified
                        the automatically blinking lights with lights that turn on by the click of a switch (that matches the color of the LED lights). Seeing all the
                        physical circuits made me think further about how machines or robots are build within the circuits, which is really enticing and exciting. </p>

                    <h2> WOT is Speculative Design? </h2>
                    <p> <b> Speculative Design is the act of designing to provoke thought rather than for a 
                        practical purpose.  </b> 
                        <br></br>
                        Speculative design involves a design methodology centered on envisioning potential future scenarios and prospects. It serves as a 
                        tool for investigating various facets including social, political, technological, and ethical considerations, fostering the generation 
                        of innovative ideas and resolutions. Unlike forecasting, speculative design doesn't aim to predict forthcoming events; rather, it delves
                        into diverse possibilities for the future. Through this process, it facilitates a deeper comprehension of the present circumstances and 
                        aids in making informed decisions concerning the future.

                    <h2> Hunt'n'Gather #8! </h2>
                    <p> Still in the world of physical computing, I researched immersive artworks that were showcased in exhibitions. For this week's
                        Hunt'n'Gather, the works I researched were: Can't Help Myself by Sun Yuan & Peng Yu, Machine Hallucinations by Nature Dreams, and Remote 
                        Entanglements by Laura Splan. I enjoyed all the works, but the most engaging work for me is Machine Hallucinations, which is a giant datasculpture
                        displaying machine-generated, dynanic pigments of nature. The artwork features a synesthetic reality experiments based on GAN algorithms developed
                        by openAI and inspired my fluid dynamics. Nature Dreams, the artist, turns datasets into latent multi-sensory experience to commemorate the beauty
                        of the world we share.

                       In the Look! Section, we looked at Harold Cohen's Drawing Machine. Being one of the earliest artificial intelligence software, Cohen's AARON is able 
                       draws sketches live from the very first stroke. The point that he wants to emphasis with his creation is <b> to make people see AI as a tool and not
                        as a solution. </b> That creative endeavours lies in its journey of process, not in its result. </p>

                    <h2> Workshop of Speculative Objects: Fish Bowl </h2>
                    <p> In this week's Arduino workshop still at the Telstra Creator Space, we continued to broaden our Arduino knowledge by building another circuit,
                        this one called "Fishbowl" in particular. The components needed for this project are: breadboard, motherboard, 10 ohm resistor, a light sensitive sensor, 
                        a server motor, and wires. This week, I partnered with Jennifer from Thursday's class to build this circuit, and we successfully are able to make this one
                        work. This immediately became one of my top picks for the most interesting Arduino live demos we've been doing as I can envision a lot of things to do with 
                        the server motor: like inserting a designed robot hand on the motor's propellet or to make something move in a certain degree. This links back to the class
                        seminar material of Speculative Design, where the theory is directly applied in my thinking. </p>

                    <h2> Workshop of Speculative Objects: Theremin </h2>
                    <p> The second circuit that we built during this week is called Theremin. The aim of this build is to utilize light & shade to play tones 
                        through the buzzer. The materials needed are: motherboard, breadboard, photoresistor, and 1 ohm resistors. Unfornutately for this circuit, me and my partner
                        did not get it to work because there is something wrong with the code. It's such a shame because I really wanted to see the tunes play out based on different kinds 
                        of light. We tried to figure out what was wrong with the code but could not alter it so that it runs. Additionally, building these Arduino projects exposed
                        me to the kinds of troubleshootings that might happen within building my Final Project, which is a critical experience to have. </p>

                    <p> This is my favorite personal circuit from this week's class as we jump onto a more complex circuit that requires lots of wires to make the 8x8 
                        LED display work. The materials used were: motherboard, breadboard, wires, 8x8 LED display, and 10 ohm resistors. The code that the LED lights will display are the
                        alphabet A, B, C, D, E, and the numbers 1 until 9. Then, me and my partner modified the code to display our own drawings which is an Among Us mascot. I was really
                        proud in seeing the circuit and code come altogether shown through the display. I can already think of so much things that I can build with the LED light component,
                        such as a machine that gives feedback in the form of emotions shown through the LEDs. </p>
