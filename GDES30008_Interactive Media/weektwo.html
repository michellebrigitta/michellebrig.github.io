                    <div class="des"> With a well-defined vision for my web workbook, I set out to craft the essential elements needed to bring my concept to life. 
                        Using Adobe Illustrator, I designed backgrounds featuring gradient skies and fluffy clouds, along with serene meadows stretching into the 
                        horizon. This initial iteration marked the beginning of my website's journey, serving as a foundational blueprint upon which I would later 
                        build and refine. Through continuous iteration and improvement, I aimed to elevate my creation to new heights, ensuring that every detail 
                        contributed to the overall experience of my web workbook that matched my personal taste.</div>

                    <div class="des"> Imagine a vast, interconnected universe where information flows freely across the globe at the click of a button - that's the 
                        World Wide Web. It's like a digital superhighway where websites are the destinations and hyperlinks are the roads that connect them. The Web 
                        isn't just about static pages; it's a dynamic, ever-expanding network where you can explore, connect, learn, and create.
                        But what makes the Web truly remarkable is its accessibility. Anyone with an internet connection and a device can tap into this virtual realm, 
                        transcending geographical boundaries and bringing people together from all corners of the earth. It's a platform for sharing ideas, sparking 
                        conversations, and building communities. Hence, the World Wide Web is a gateway to an infinite universe of possibilities.

                    <div class="name">Hunt'n'Gather #2!</div>
                    <div class="des"> In this second Hunt'n'Gather, we were told to search for quirky webpages or web-apps. I found 3 webpages which I found really intriguing,
                        the first is called Nomadic Tribe. This is an animated webpage, almost like a game where you can interact with the elements provided in the website.
                        It tells the story of a group of people who have to move to a newfound island, leaving their old habitat. Users can click and hold to grow a plant,
                        and this really inspired me for the base of my workbook website. The amazing features and interactivity of this site made me want to do the same with mine.
                        What Nomadic Tribe really about is a new years greeting website, indicating that we should leave our bad old habits and move into fresh good ones for the upcoming
                        year. The second page is from Nike, where we can customise our own 3D simulation of how the new Nike shoes feel like. The last webpage is a fun idea of "waking" 
                        up a sleeping site within 60 seconds. I feel like the interactivities of these two sites were compelling, enabling users to contribute and customise their own
                        experience of the site. 
                        <br></br> For the Look! section, I looked at two websites, JODI.org and theuselessweb.com. These sites were very thought-provoking, especially the JODI one 
                        as I did not know exactly what it does, but it literally looks like a code presented in a webpage. It seems like a game but then I have to download it, which
                        I did not click as it looks suspicious .__. Later I found out that the JODI site takes you to different interfaces everytime you click it, which actually,
                        is really cool.

                    <div class="des"> During the studio class, we embarked on a thrilling journey of creativity through a brainstorming activity called Crazy 8s. It's like a whirlwind 
                        of ideas, pushing us to generate eight distinct concepts for how we could approach our website designs. With the clock ticking and pens flying, we feverishly 
                        sketched eight different home page layouts, each bursting with potential. This rapid-fire exercise ignited my imagination like never before, forcing me to think 
                        outside the box and explore unconventional ideas. Amidst the chaos, one concept emerged as a beacon of inspiration: the image of raining clouds nurturing a tiny 
                        seed, gradually blossoming into a magnificent flower. 
                        <br> <b> It was a moment of pure clarity as I realized this concept perfectly encapsulated the essence of my web 
                        workbook - a journey of growth and transformation. </b> </br> 
                        With newfound excitement, I'm ready to cultivate this vision into a mesmerizing digital experience that will captivate and inspire visitors.

                    <div class="des"> With my vision firmly in place for my web workbook, I dove into the next phase of its creation through the "Make it Bling!" acitivty: which is to
                        create a wireframe of the homepage. This activity allowed me to breathe life into my concept by crafting detailed elements of the interface. From selecting 
                        the perfect color palette to choosing fonts that spoke to the essence of my project, every decision felt like a brushstroke on the canvas of my imagination. 
                        With the momentum building, I knew clearly where I was heading with my web workbook, and proceed to create the elements through Illustrator.

                    <div class="des"> Sometimes, stepping away from digital screens and pens is just what a creative soul needs. So, I decided to take a refreshing break and embarked 
                        on an excursion to the Queen Victoria Market. Amidst the vibrant chaos of the market, I explored each and every flower shop to find inspiration and references 
                        for my flower model.  Eventually, I settled on a flower: the Orchid Cactus. Often overlooked for its unconventional appearance, this humble plant transforms 
                        into a breathtaking spectacle when it blooms. Its dinner-plate-sized flowers, adorned with silky petals in a myriad of hues, captured my imagination and 
                        sparked a wave of inspiration for my web workbook. This excursion was more than just a journey through the market; it was also a healing experience, reconnecting 
                        me with the simple joy and beauty of nature. </div>
