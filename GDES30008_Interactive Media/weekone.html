                        seeing this artwork, it really left an impression on me as it is very unsettlingly interesting. You can see dozens of box stacked up
                        with a virtual reality of the crawling man. Additionally, you can also scan a barcode and therefore, the crawling man will be with you
                        wherever you go. The digital screen is actually programmed to crawl for the length of the artist's life (36 years). The other two, Apple

                    <div class="des"> The first week begins by understanding the term "Interactive Media". Interactive media represents a computational 
                        approach influenced by cybernetics, autopoiesis, and system theories, challenging traditional understandings of reasoning, cognition, 
                        perception, memory, emotions, and affection. It encompasses various concepts such as interaction design, new media, interactivity, 
                        human-computer interaction, cyberculture, and digital culture, while also potentially incorporating augmented reality and virtual reality. 
                        The term "interactive media" encompasses any medium where there is an interface between the user/audience and the content, extending beyond 
                        electronic or digital formats to include analog forms like board games, pop-up books, flip books, and constellation wheels. </div>

                        My group successfully brought all needed tags but we were not able to figure out how to place images side by side :D

                    <div class="des"> In this workshop, we were given pieces of paper to write an activity we did that day. Then, randomly each person will pick the 
                        paper to recreate the gesture of the activity, without actually using the items. Most people wrote activities that they do with their phones,
                        like swiping or scrolling on their phones, which made it really easy to guess. However, some people also wrote interesting ones like unlocking
                        a car or locking the door. This was the highlight of week one!
