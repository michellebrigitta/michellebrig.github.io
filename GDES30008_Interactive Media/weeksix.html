                    <div class="des"> From the feedbacks provided on my first submission, I refined my website especially regarding its navigating system. I added a drop down navigation menu for all the
                        weeks so that the site is easier to navigate and can move from any week to another. I also added a heading for each week's page to indicate what week that page is for, as it gets 
                        quite confusing without any indicator. The slider button on the bottom of each week's page is also refined by adding a "Prev" tag to slide left, and "Right" tag to slide right.
                        Additionally, as I build on my website, the flower bud also grows to be a blooming flower with full petals.

                        <br> 
                        Data as we know it, with its infinite amount, does not live in a weightless cloud. It actually lives under the sea, as , 99% of the data travels between economies and continents 
                        through undersea cables. There are currently about 400 active undersea cables, each no larger than the diameter of a soda can. It is an enormous task to lay these cables across the Atlantic 
                        and Pacific oceans, some of which are as deep as Mount Everest is high. It requires billions of dollars, years of route study, and big ships that can transport cables that can span several 
                        thousand km. The optical fibre, the cable's principal component, is minuscule compared to a hair. A few optical fibre pairs on each cable are shielded from harm by fishing vessels, boats, 
                        and natural calamities by multiple layers of protection. These cables are significantly more cost-effective and efficient than satellites, even though laying them is expensive and challenging. 
                        Although optical fibre has been around for a while, its cutting-edge technology allows data to move at rates that are almost equal to the speed of light.

                    <div class="des"> For the sixth Hunt'n'Gather, I came across 3 noteworthy 3D generative art and creative coding works. The first work is Land Lines by Zach Lieberman, which lets the user draw
                        any shape of line and the site will match it a Google Maps top elevation to create a continuous line of artwork. The interactivity of this site is that it asks user input in the forms of lines
                        and shapes, which in turn are converted into real spaces on earth that resembles that line/shape. The second work is New Nature Digital Petting Zoo by Marpi Studio. <b> This is the most appealing 
                            3D generative art I found out of all three. Through machine learning, Marpi has forged a virtual terrarium of creatures, plants, and animals that rely on physical interactions of the viewers. </b> 
                            As viewers engage by waving their hand/touching the screen, the artwork responds with real-time computer-generated motions, simulating the movement of an organic creature being pet. The last
                        is Infinite Comman Team by Casey Reas which investigates the relationship between particles that are encoded to construct images. By using pixelation, this site constructs a digital mosaic
                        of abstract & collage-like images.

                        On the Look! Section, as one of the site listed is forbidden, I cannot access it. Instead, I re-explored Angelo Plessas which exposed me with new interesting interactivities:
                        an illustration that follows the user's cursor, equipped with clapping, banging, and zen-type sound effects. Then, I also opened the site Open Processing and played the game inside, which is 
                        a shooting game that utilizes keys to interact with moving shapes and arrows.

                    <div class="des"> During the workshop activity this week, two super cool people from <b> The Data Garden Project! </b> Jo and Mei showed us how to visualize data using primarily sounds,
                        but also shapes. We are asked to record a sound for 15 seconds, and I recorded a sound of the tap running. With it, they taught us how to visualize the different amplitudes 
                        of sounds (high and low) with a vertex point, forming a graph. The most crucial part is that we can customize it however we like as they taught us the basics of the code using
                        if statements. I truly enjoyed this class as I think The Data Garden Project is a really cool organisation that perfectly matches what we are learning in this subject. Jo and Mei 
                        are such sweethearts as they listened to every question and curiosity we have!!

                    <div class="des"> On the 8th of April, I did my homework of having one whole day with 10 activities decided by the roll of a dice. I asked my roommate to roll the dice, so that 
                        I feel like I absolutely have no control over my decisions. With 10 activities of choosing outfit colors, top, bottoms, lunch, drink, shoes, payment of method, method
                        of transport, whether to buy something or not, and study place, I became a slave to the algorithm and went with everything chosen by the roll of a dice. The rules are: for 
                        odd number = go ahead with option 1, for even number = go ahead with option 2. The results are on that day, I: wore a white short sleeve shirt with short pants, eating rice 
                        for lunch and drinking juice, with an open toe sandal, paying for everything with card, walking everywhere to my destination, saying yes to everything I wanted to buy that day,
                        and lastly study at home. I remember clearly that during that day, it was raining and quite cold, but I stand by the choice decided from the dice. Even though I came back with 
                        a runny nose, it's such a unique experience of not having full control over my own decisions, to receive things by chance. <b> 8/10 would recommend people doing it at least once in their life! </b>
