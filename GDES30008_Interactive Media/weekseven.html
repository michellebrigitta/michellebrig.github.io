                    <h2> Workshop: BLINK BUZZ VROOM Circuit #2 </h2>
                    <p> The second circuit that we have to build for the day was slightly more complicated. We needed to build
                        a proximity sensor which gives the users a feedback if they are too close in the form of a buzzer noise. The components 
                        needed are: mother board, bread board, ultrasonic buzzer, standard buzzer, and wire. What this project does is that it
                        lets out a big noise from the buzzer when you have your fingers covering up the ultrasonic buzzer. The code is pretty
                        easy as me and Sammy successfully got the circuit working and responsing to our hands. This is really fun 
                        to do and I think I'm starting to get more comfortable in Physical Computing rather thant just sitting for hours. </p>

                        Physical computing involves interacting with the physical world in addition to a screen. It 
                        encompasses gathering data from various sensors detecting light, motion, or temperature, and managing 
                        devices like motors, speakers, and lights. This approach to computing fosters enjoyment, involvement, 
                        and facilitates the comprehension of coding concepts. Arduino and micro:bit emerge as accessible and 
                        widely recognized platforms suitable for learners of all ages, offering opportunities to create interactive 
                        electronic projects. In this subject particularly, the platform Arduino is used. I was so excited for this 
                        week's class regarding physical computing, as it is a whole new world I never explored before. For the next
                        three weeks (from weeks 7-9), we will immerse in the world of Arduino at the Telstra Creator Space, which 
                        also serves as a new and fresh learning environment for me.

                    <p> For this week's Hunt'n'Gather, I immersed myself in the world of physical computing. The works I researched were all
                        quite interesting and I love how all of them explored the physical space thoroughly, stepping away from screens. The works I looked 
                        at were: Body Sculpture by Jordan Wolfson, Blank Stare in "Paint to Print," and Drawing Machine by Harold Cohen. The most interesting
                        piece is the Blank Stare, where a <b> laser-etching machine draws a pattern on a paper based from the user's brain activity, utiling an 
                        Electroencephalogram (EEG). </b> The machine singed the waveform directly & repeatedly into the paper's surface to form a hypnotic, radial pattern. </p>

                    <h2> Watch! Sisters with Transistors </h2>
                    <p> In my free time, I tried watching Sisters with Transistors as recommended in this week's module. Overall,
                        this movie offers an exceptional documentary that empowers the female in a male-lead industry, which is the electronic music industry. 
                        It also presents itself as a long-overdue and rarely acknowledged homage to the female composers, musicians, and innovators who have 
                        contributed to the relatively brief history of electronic music. The film primarily focuses on approximately nine to ten women within 
                        this field, spanning from Clara Rockmore, a pioneering figure in experimental music who mastered the Theremin in elegant 
                        evening attire, to Delia Derbyshire, a British composer and mathematician renowned for her co-creation of the iconic Doctor 
                        Who theme.
                        <br></br>
                        Sisters with Transistors not only chronicles the remarkable achievements of women in electronic music but also serves as an 
                        inspiring narrative for the intersection of creativity and technology. The film underscores the innovative spirit and experimental 
                        mindset of these artists, many of whom were essentially engaging in early forms of physical computing through their manipulation of 
                        electronic sound. This movie inspires me so much especially as a woman myself, to push the boundaries and test the limits of what I 
                        believe I can do. </p>

                    <h2> Workshop: WOT's in the Box? </h2>
                    <p> At the start of this week's workshop, we were given a box of electronic kit. We don't know anything at all at the time, not
                        even the name of the device we were working with. A piece of paper were given for us to put the different components on top and try
                        to name them based on what we perceive them to be. This is quite a fun activity as we get to work with our mental models, of what We
                        think the thing is and what it actually does. At the end, we were told the correct names for each component and therefore, we have 
                        successfully learned the basics of Arduino. </p>

                    <p> For the first workshop experiment, we worked in pairs to get to build a very basic circuit that would make the LED lights blink on and off
                        automatically within the time frame that we have code. The components needed are: motherboard, bread board, LED lights of any color (I chose red), a 220 ohm resistor, 
                        and wires, which utilizes very little materials and effort. However, despite the easiness of building this circuit this was still my first Arduino project,
                        which is why I feel so satisfied to see the code and build work along with Sammy, my partner for the day. </p>
