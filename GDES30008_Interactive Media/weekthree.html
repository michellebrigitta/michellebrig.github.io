                    <p> In the final moments before submission, I refined my website with little details to elevate the user experience and showcase a 
                        little bit of my personality. I incorporated a unique custom cursor that matches the concept of my site, which is a watering can. The cursor 
                        also changes into a water droplet for clickable buttons (Week One, Two, Three pages). To complete the concept of "growth", I introduced a 
                        captivating rain animation, imbuing it with dynamic movement and depth. Additionally, I included a favicon as taught in tutorials, a small 
                        yet impactful detail that enhances brand recognition and usability. </p>

                    <h2> Publishing the Web </h2>
                    <p> On the third week's studio class, we were taught how to create public repositories to publish the link of our
                        website through GitHub. Additionally, we posted the current state of our website on Milanote to show our work in progress
                        and receive feedback. I gained a lot of insights too as I ask questions to Matilda and Karen about the troubles I encounter 
                        while building my website. </p>

                    <p> For the third Hunt'n'Gather, we gathered 3 engaging web archives or galleries of work. I found a lot of fantastic websites 
                        which I am fond of: Heilig Objects, Puppy Love, and Felix Hieronimus. All these websites show images or works in a refreshing way, making the
                        user want to stay longer and see more works. The similarities of these websites are how they use animation and customization on their sites: 
                        color-changing header by scrolling, customizable background color, and changing shapes within clicks. On the Look! section, I looked at 
                        commercial, games, and museum websites to inspect the elements used: fonts, color palette, buttons, and features. </p>

                    <h2> Workshop: Fluid Design </h2>
                    <p> In the workshops, we engaged in an insightful activity of "Fluid Design," aimed at mastering the art of responsive web design.  
                        The task is to  create  a design that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, primarily mobile. As I brainstormed and sketched a wireframe 
                        of my web workbook's mobile layout, I quickly realized the intricacies involved in ensuring optimal usability across different devices. With 
                        each element meticulously adjusted in size, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of responsive design. This activity served me 
                        a valuable lesson, highlighting the need to prioritize adaptability in today's digital landscape. </p>

                    <h2> Redesigning the Scenery </h2>
                    <p> Feeling dissatisfied with the simplicity of the scenery design in my workbook from the previous week, I embarked on a journey 
                        of creative transformation. This process began with an exploration of inspirations, seeking out visual cues that would inject depth and 
                        richness into my work. After settling on a soft color palette that resonated with my vision, I sketched the outlines of the illustrations. 
                        Then, utilizing Adobe Illustrator, I filled in the sketches with gradient colors, layering depth and texture to give life into the scene. 
                        This resulted in a depiction of harmonious mountains and lush meadows, a scene that truly speaks to my aesthetic sensibilities. This evolution 
                        in my scenery design not only reflects my growth as a designer, but also accentuates how prominent experimentation and iteration is in a world 
                        of design. </p>

                    <p> Over the past three weeks, I diligently gathered documentation of the projects and works I've completed both in and out of class, 
                        assembling a comprehensive portfolio to showcase my progress. . Before integrating them into my website, I took the step of editing each photo 
                        to align with my site's color palette, with the purpose of maintaining a consistent and harmonious visual aesthetic throughout. The thought 
                        behind approach was to enhance the overall cohesiveness of my website while also reinforcing my personal brand identity. </p>
