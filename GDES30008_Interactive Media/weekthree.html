                        little bit of my personality. I incorporated a unique custom cursor that matches the concept of my site, which is a watering can. The cursor 
                        also changes into a water droplet for clickable buttons (Week One, Two, Three pages). To complete the concept of "growth", I introduced a 
                        captivating rain animation, imbuing it with dynamic movement and depth. Additionally, I included a favicon as taught in tutorials, a small 
                        yet impactful detail that enhances brand recognition and usability. </div>

                        website through GitHub. Additionally, we posted the current state of our website on Milanote to show our work in progress
                        and receive feedback. I gained a lot of insights too as I ask questions to Matilda and Karen about the troubles I encounter 
                        while building my website. </div>

                        which I am fond of: Heilig Objects, Puppy Love, and Felix Hieronimus. All these websites show images or works in a refreshing way, making the
                        user want to stay longer and see more works. The similarities of these websites are how they use animation and customization on their sites: 
                        color-changing header by scrolling, customizable background color, and changing shapes within clicks. On the Look! section, I looked at 
                        commercial, games, and museum websites to inspect the elements used: fonts, color palette, buttons, and features.

                    <div class="des"> In the workshops, we engaged in an insightful activity of "Fluid Design," aimed at mastering the art of responsive web design.  
                        The task is to  create  a design that seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes, primarily mobile. As I brainstormed and sketched a wireframe 
                        of my web workbook's mobile layout, I quickly realized the intricacies involved in ensuring optimal usability across different devices. With 
                        each element meticulously adjusted in size, I gained a deeper appreciation for the importance of responsive design. This activity served me 
                        a valuable lesson, highlighting the need to prioritize adaptability in today's digital landscape.

                    <div class="des"> Feeling dissatisfied with the simplicity of the scenery design in my workbook from the previous week, I embarked on a journey 
                        of creative transformation. This process began with an exploration of inspirations, seeking out visual cues that would inject depth and 
                        richness into my work. After settling on a soft color palette that resonated with my vision, I sketched the outlines of the illustrations. 
                        Then, utilizing Adobe Illustrator, I filled in the sketches with gradient colors, layering depth and texture to give life into the scene. 
                        This resulted in a depiction of harmonious mountains and lush meadows, a scene that truly speaks to my aesthetic sensibilities. This evolution 
                        in my scenery design not only reflects my growth as a designer, but also accentuates how prominent experimentation and iteration is in a world 
                        of design.

                        assembling a comprehensive portfolio to showcase my progress. . Before integrating them into my website, I took the step of editing each photo 
                        to align with my site's color palette, with the purpose of maintaining a consistent and harmonious visual aesthetic throughout. The thought 
                        behind approach was to enhance the overall cohesiveness of my website while also reinforcing my personal brand identity.  </div>
